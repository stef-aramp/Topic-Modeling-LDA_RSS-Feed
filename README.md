# Topic-Modeling-LDA_RSS-Feed
Generate topics with unsupervised learning method.


### Description: 

This is an unsupervised learning problem, and I have to generate topics because the data we got is unlabeled (or uncategorized). Topic Modelling is different from rule-based text mining approaches that use regular expressions or dictionary based keyword searching techniques. There are severals ways to face a problem like that but I do prefer to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm which is a statistical model. Another way to solve such problems is k-means algorithm, but it's a distance measure algorithm. On the other hand, LDA's based on the bag-of-words representation of documents. LDA can give more realistic results than k-means for topic assignment.
